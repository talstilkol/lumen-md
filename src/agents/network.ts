/**
 * The network gate for agent tools (scope `network`).
 *
 * Under the `local-only` AI policy nothing may leave the device — with one
 * explicit exception (plan §2.4): web research, which by its nature asks
 * the web. A network tool call therefore goes out only when the user
 * consented to that call (asked per call — plan 15.10 (8)); otherwise it is
 * refused before any request is made,
 * the refusal is recorded in the privacy ledger and the call fails with
 * the ledger's `PrivacyBlockedError`. Under `local-first` / `cloud` the
 * policy itself allows the network.
 *
 * Either way the tool gets a fetch built by the ledger (`ledgerFetch`), so
 * each request it makes is recorded (host, bytes, reason, policy, and
 * whether it went out on consent). A network tool has no other way to the
 * network: without the gate's fetch it refuses to run (`networkFetch`).
