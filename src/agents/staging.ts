/**
 * Staged changes — what agent write tools produce instead of writing.
 *
 * An agent never changes a file or the open document by itself. A write
 * tool (`write_file`, `set_frontmatter`, `replace_range`) computes the
 * change and the runtime stages it here; the user approves or rejects it,
 * and only an approval writes. The run's trace lists the staged ids
 * (`AgentRun.staged`), so every proposal can be traced to the run, the
 * agent and the tool call that made it.
 *
 * Two kinds:
 *   file   create / overwrite a workspace file. Approving writes it, but
 *          only if the file still has the content the change was computed
 *          from (`before`); otherwise the change is marked `conflict` and
 *          nothing is written.
 *   range  replace [from, to) of the open document. When the text is still
 *          the one the change was computed on (`basis`), possibly with
 *          other approved changes applied since, the offsets are exact
 *          (mapped through those). Otherwise the text at [from, to) must
 *          still be `before` with its surroundings (`context`) — when it
 *          moved, the single place where they occur is used instead;
 *          otherwise `conflict` (`locateRange`).
 *
 * Both kinds go to the document applier the editor registers
 * (`setDocumentApplier`, `documentApplier.ts`) first: a change to a
 * document that is open — the active one or another tab — is applied to
 * its live text (unsaved edits included, undo in the source editor), not
 * to the file underneath it. The applier answers `null` for a document
 * that is not open, and the change goes to its workspace file instead.
 *
 * The queue lives in memory for the session (a proposal is only meaningful
 * against the document it was computed from) and is capped; listeners
 * (the review panel, `ui/AgentReviewPanel.tsx`) are told about every
 * change. A run that is cancelled withdraws its pending proposals
 * (`discardRunChanges`).
