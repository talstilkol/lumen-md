/**
 * The encrypted sync engine (plan 3.4).
 *
 * One round, `E2eeSync.sync()`:
 *
 *   1. Read the manifest and its etag; decrypt and authenticate it; refuse it
 *      if it is older than the newest one this device has verified
 *      (`checkFreshness` — rollback / replay protection).
 *   2. Pull: for every path the manifest changed since this device's base,
 *      apply the change locally, or settle a conflict (conflict.ts).
 *   3. Push: upload every local change as a new immutable blob (a fresh
 *      opaque name per version, so concurrent devices never overwrite each
 *      other's blobs), then write the new manifest — counter + 1 — with
 *      compare-and-swap on the etag read in step 1.
 *   4. If the manifest changed in between (`PreconditionFailedError`), go back
 *      to 1 with the newer manifest: pull, merge, retry. Two devices pushing
 *      from the same version N both end up in the manifest.
 *
 * Keys (plan W1.7): at the start of a round the device brings its keys up to
 * the keyring (./keyring.ts): a keyring that doesn't descend from the one it
 * verified last is a rollback or a fork and refused, a missing wrap means
 * this device was revoked. `rekey()` starts a new epoch; blobs keep the
 * epoch they were written in (`e` in their manifest entry).
 *
 * A re-key has one commit point, the keyring write (re-review 12.11, RR-3):
 *
 *   1. freeze: the manifest of epoch n is written once more, marked frozen
 *      (compare-and-swap), so nobody adds to it any more;
 *   2. the manifest of epoch n + 1 — the frozen one's successor, sealed with
 *      the new keys — is created under its random label (unreadable and
 *      unnamed until the keyring names it; deleted if the commit loses);
 *   3. commit: the keyring for n + 1, compare-and-swap on the keyring this
 *      device verified. From here on the vault is at n + 1;
 *   4. a passphrase change writes the new header, then rewrites the keyring
 *      without the pending header (any device at n + 1 finishes this).
 *
 * A freeze is called off through the keyring too (RR-4): a device that has
 * waited `FREEZE_TTL_MS` on its own clock for a frozen manifest rewrites the
 * keyring at the same epoch, listing the freeze as aborted — so the
 * re-keyer's commit, a compare-and-swap on the keyring, fails if anybody
 * wrote over its freeze. At epoch 0 (no keyring yet) it finishes the re-key
 * instead, for the passphrase alone. Blobs replaced by a commit over a freeze
 * are deleted only a round later.
 *
 * Interruption at any point loses nothing: blobs are written before the
 * manifest that references them, the base is saved per file after the local
 * write, and the next round recognises work that was already done (same hash
 * on both sides). Blobs uploaded by an interrupted round are recorded as
 * pending and deleted once they are known to be unreferenced; blobs replaced
 * by a commit are deleted after it.
