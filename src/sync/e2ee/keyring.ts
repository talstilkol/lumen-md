/**
 * The keyring (plan W1.7): key rotation and device revocation.
 *
 * Without a keyring (epoch 0) all keys come from the passphrase: anyone who
 * ever knew it, or kept the derived keys, can read the vault for good. The
 * keyring adds an *epoch secret*, 32 random bytes, from which the manifest,
 * blob and pairing keys of that epoch derive (keys.ts `epochKeys`). It is
 * stored at the provider under the fixed name `lumen-e2ee-keyring`:
 *
 *   {
 *     format: "lumen-e2ee-keyring", protocol: 2, vaultId, epoch,
 *     passphrase: {n, c},          // AES-GCM(wrap key from the passphrase, secret)
 *     devices: { <id>: { recipient: "age1…", wrap: "<base64 age file of the secret>" } },
 *     sealed: {n, c},              // AES-GCM(epoch's keyring key, JSON KeyringContents)
 *     header?: "<b64u>",           // a passphrase change: the new vault header, until it is written
 *     prev?: "<b64u>",             // with `header`: the keyring this one replaced (the old passphrase's way back)
 *     dropped?: [{epoch, at, devices, mac}]  // devices a re-key from an unverified device left out (F4)
 *   }
 *
 * Every AES-GCM has the protocol, the vault id, the epoch and its role as
 * additional data, so a wrap can't be moved to another epoch, vault or
 * device. `older` holds the secrets of all earlier epochs, so blobs written
 * before a re-key stay readable: a re-key writes a new manifest and the
 * keyring, and nothing else, with no blob downloaded or uploaded again.
 *
 * Who is enrolled (review 12.11): the plaintext `devices` map only lets a
 * device find its own wrap. The list a re-key wraps the next secret for is
 * the sealed `devices` (id → recipient), which only holders of the epoch's
 * secret can write, minus every device in the sealed `revoked` list. A
 * keyring without that sealed list (protocol 1: pre-release builds only) is
 * refused (`PreReleaseKeyringError`); the passphrase can reset it to a new
 * epoch wrapped for nobody but the passphrase, and devices enroll again.
 *
 * Which keyring (re-review 12.11, RR-2): every keyring names the one it
 * replaced. The sealed part has a per-epoch revision `rev` (0 for a new
 * epoch, + 1 for each rewrite at the same epoch: an enrollment, an aborted
 * re-key, a finished passphrase change), `parent` (the replaced keyring's
 * digest, `keyringDigest`) and `chain`, the last `CHAIN_LENGTH` (epoch, rev, digest)
 * before it. A device remembers the (epoch, rev, digest) it verified last
 * and accepts only a keyring that descends from it: an older epoch or rev
 * is a rollback, another keyring at the same epoch and rev or a chain that
 * doesn't list it is a fork (`KeyringForkError`). A keyring at the same epoch
 * that this device's epoch key can't open is a fork too.
 *
 * Each epoch's manifest has a random label (`manifest/<epoch>/<random>`,
 * RR-3) in the sealed part: nobody without the epoch's secret can name it in
 * advance.
