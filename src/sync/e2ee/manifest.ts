/**
 * The manifest (plan 3.4, steps 1, 7, 8): the vault's table of contents.
 *
 * It lists every path with its own version number, a random revision id (the
 * blob of that version is stored under `blobName(path, rev)`), the SHA-256 of
 * the plaintext and a tombstone flag for deletions. It also carries a
 * monotonic `counter`, raised by one on every write of the manifest.
 *
 * The manifest is sealed with AES-256-GCM (keys.ts), so the provider sees
 * neither paths, nor versions, nor the counter, and cannot change a byte of
 * it. Because only holders of the passphrase-derived key can produce a valid
 * manifest, the counter is authenticated by the AEAD tag — that is the
 * "signed" counter of the plan. A signature (Ed25519) would add nothing
 * against the provider: every device that can sync holds the same key anyway,
 * and telling devices apart from each other is not in this threat model (see
 * docs/src/content/docs/sync/e2ee.md).
 *
 * Rollback guard (`checkFreshness`): a device remembers the highest counter
 * it has verified and the digest of that manifest. It refuses a manifest with
 * a lower counter (a replay of an old state) and one with the same counter
 * but different content (a fork).
