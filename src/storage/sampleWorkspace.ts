# 👋 Welcome to the Lumen sample workspace

This folder is a tiny, linked knowledge base. Every note below is plain Markdown stored in your browser — edit, rename or delete anything.

## Where to go next

- [[Project Board]] — a **database view** built from note frontmatter
- [[Website Redesign]] — a project note with a **Mermaid** diagram
- [[Metrics]] — a **CSV table** and an **ECharts** chart
- [[Weekly Review]] — a **template** you can copy for each week

Open the backlinks panel on any note to see which notes point at it.

## Try this

- [x] Open the sample workspace
- [ ] Click a [[Metrics|wiki-link]] (aliases work too)
- [ ] Filter the file tree by the \`#project\` tag
- [ ] Drag a card on the [[Project Board]]
- [ ] Duplicate the [[Weekly Review]] template

# Project Board

Every note in \`Projects/\` with \`type: project\` in its frontmatter shows up here. Change a note's \`status:\` and the card moves column.

\`\`\`database
title: Projects by status
source: ${projects}
type: project
view: kanban
groupBy: status
sortBy: due
fields: [title, owner, due, status]
\`\`\`

The same data as a table:

\`\`\`database
source: ${projects}
type: project
view: table
sortBy: -priority
fields: [title, owner, priority, due]
\`\`\`

Back to [[Start Here]].

# Metrics

Paste CSV straight into a fenced block and Lumen renders a sortable table with chart suggestions:

\`\`\`csv title="Weekly visitors"
week,visitors,signups
W1,1200,48
W2,1350,61
W3,1610,70
W4,1980,92
\`\`\`

Or write an explicit chart:

\`\`\`chart
xAxis: { type: category, data: [W1, W2, W3, W4] }
yAxis: { type: value }
tooltip: { trigger: axis }
series:
  - { name: Signups, type: line, smooth: true, data: [48, 61, 70, 92] }
\`\`\`

Used by [[Website Redesign]] and [[Docs Refresh]].
