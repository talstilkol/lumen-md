/**
 * The vault layer (plan 4.1): one interface between Lumen and wherever the
 * user's notes are stored.
 *
 * Today the notes live in the browser's Origin Private File System (OPFS);
 * tomorrow they can live in a real folder — a FileSystemDirectoryHandle the
 * user picked in Chromium (plan 4.3) or the desktop file system through
 * Tauri (plan 4.2) — and safe git (3.3) and encryption (11.4) sit on top of
 * the same calls. Everything that reads or writes vault files goes through
 * a `VaultBackend`: the workspace module (src/storage/workspace.ts keeps its
 * public functions as thin wrappers over the active backend), and through it
 * the index, the file tree, git, embeddings, search, export, trash and the
 * canvases. Only the backend implementations under src/storage/vault/ touch
 * the browser's file-system handles; `npm run hygiene` enforces that.
 *
 * Paths are forward-slash, relative to the vault root, without a leading
 * slash (`notes/2026/april.md`); "" is the root. Empty segments are ignored
 * (`a//b` = `a/b`), `.` and `..` segments are refused, so no path can leave
 * the vault. Names are case-sensitive and compared as given (no Unicode
 * normalisation).
 *
 * Every backend must pass the contract suite in
 * src/__tests__/vaultBackend.contract.test.ts.
