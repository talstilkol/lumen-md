/**
 * The desktop app's system-wide capture shortcut (plan 4.16): ⌥⌘N on macOS
 * brings Lumen to the front with the capture box open, even when another
 * app has the focus.
 *
 * macOS only. On Windows and Linux the same keys are Ctrl+Alt+N, which many
 * layouts produce with AltGr+N: a system-wide hook can't tell the two apart
 * (unlike the in-window handler, which checks AltGraph), so typing that
 * character in any app would open Lumen (review: #268). There the in-window
 * shortcut, the command palette and File ▸ Quick capture stay the way in.
 *
 * A system-wide shortcut needs Tauri's global-shortcut plugin, which the
 * desktop shell does not bundle yet (src-tauri/Cargo.toml has only the
 * dialog and fs plugins). So this is a feature check: it asks the plugin
 * to register the shortcut through Tauri's IPC, and when the plugin is
 * missing the call fails and nothing else happens — the in-window ⌥⌘N and
 * the File ▸ Quick capture menu item (which work today) stay the way in.
 * docs/src/content/docs/workspace/quick-capture.md lists the three lines
 * that turn it on.
 *
 * Loaded only inside the desktop app.
