/**
 * Search tokens for BM25 (plan 5.2), Hebrew-aware.
 *
 * Every word becomes its comparison form (`normalizeForMatch`: niqqud
 * stripped, final letters folded, lower-cased). A Hebrew word also yields
 * its forms without prefix letters (ו ה ב כ ל מ ש, `prefixVariants`) as
 * separate "stem" terms, marked with a leading `~`, so that "בבית",
 * "והבית" and "בית" meet on `~בית` while the exact form keeps its own,
 * stronger term. Stripping is careful: one letter at a time, at most three,
 * never below three letters — and a stem is only extra evidence, weighted
 * lower at query time, so a word that merely starts with a prefix letter
 * ("שלום" → "~לום") does not drown the exact match.
 *
 * Queries drop a few function words (question words, prepositions,
 * pronouns) that carry no topic; documents keep them (BM25's idf already
 * makes them cheap, and a note may be searched for one).
 *
 * Plan W2.11 adds morphology (text/hebrewMorph): every Hebrew word, and
 * each of its prefix-less forms, also yields its full/defective spelling
 * key (`≈`) and its lemma keys (`≃`), and a query word also asks for its
 * synonyms and, for a Hebrew word, its English equivalents. All of these
 * weigh less than the exact word.
