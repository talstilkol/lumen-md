/**
 * Citations to your own notes in "Ask the vault" answers (T29).
 *
 * The model is asked to back each claim with a source number and a short
 * verbatim quote: `[2] "the exact words"`. Here each citation is checked
 * against the note it names — the quote must really be there, word for word
 * (`quoteContained`: the prompt promises an exact quote, and an approximate
 * match would pass a quote that drops a "not") — and is
 * resolved to the line it sits on, so the answer links to note + line.
 * An answer with no verified citation is flagged as unsupported.
