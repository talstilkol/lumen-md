/**
 * AI policy — where a request is allowed to go.
 *
 *   local-only   Nothing leaves the machine: Ollama, in-browser WebGPU and
 *                transformers.js only. A cloud provider is never contacted,
 *                not even as a fallback when the local model is unavailable.
 *   local-first  Local executors first; a cloud provider (with the user's
 *                own key) only when none of them can answer.
 *   cloud        The selected cloud provider is used directly.
 *
 * The stored value (`lumen.ai.policy`) wins. Until the user picks one, the
 * default is `local-only` — except for an installation that was already
 * set up for the cloud before policies existed, which keeps the behaviour
 * it had so an upgrade never silently changes where prompts go:
 *   - a cloud provider selected explicitly in `lumen.ai.provider` → `cloud`;
 *   - otherwise a cloud key configured (the old "WebGPU with OpenAI as the
 *     fallback" setup) → `local-first`.
 * The AI settings panel shows the effective policy and lets the user pin it.
