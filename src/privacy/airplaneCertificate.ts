 * window listed, and the exact scope of what it counts (`counts` /
 * `notCounted`, review 12.11), as canonical JSON (keys sorted, no whitespace: the same
 * certificate always gives the same bytes) and its SHA-256.
 *
 * Signing: the plan signs it with the signed privacy report's mechanism
 * (W2.24: a minisign Ed25519 key of this device). That work is not on this
 * branch's base yet, so `sealCertificate` takes the signer as a parameter;
 * without one the certificate carries its digest only, which proves the file
 * was not changed after it was made only to someone who saw the digest then.
 * When W2.24 is merged, pass its signer here (one line in NetworkMonitor).
