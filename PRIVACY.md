# Lumen Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-05-22

Lumen is a local-first markdown editor. **By default, no data leaves your device.** This document describes what data Lumen handles, where it lives, and the few cases where data crosses the network.

## TL;DR

| Data | Where it lives | Leaves your device? |
|---|---|---|
| Your documents | OPFS (origin-private file system in your browser) | **No** |
| Editor preferences (theme, locale, view mode, etc.) | `localStorage["lumen-md"]` | **No** |
| Search history | `localStorage["lumen-search-history"]` | **No** |
| Onboarding state | `localStorage["lumen-tour-done"]` | **No** |
| OAuth tokens (Google Drive, Dropbox) | `localStorage["lumen.gdrive.token"]`, `localStorage["lumen.dropbox.token"]` | Only when **you** opt-in to cloud sync |
| AI API key | In-memory only (never persisted) | Sent to the AI provider you configured (e.g. OpenAI) on each request |
| Telemetry | Disabled by default. Opt-in via Sentry DSN environment variable. | Only if your operator configured `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` |
| Collab session state | Peer-to-peer over WebRTC | Only between you and your collab peers |

## Local storage breakdown

Lumen uses two browser storage layers:

1. **OPFS** for documents and assets. This is sandboxed per-origin and is the modern replacement for IndexedDB blobs. The contents of your workspace stay on your device unless you explicitly export, publish, or sync them.
2. **localStorage** for small key/value preferences. The complete list of keys is namespaced under `lumen-*` and `lumen.*`. You can wipe all of it via the in-app "Reset workspace state" affordance (which calls `clearAllLumenLocalStorage()`).

## Cloud sync (opt-in)

If you configure Google Drive or Dropbox sync from Settings, Lumen will:

- Initiate an OAuth flow with the chosen provider.
- Store the returned access/refresh tokens in `localStorage`.
- Push and pull your workspace documents to/from the provider's API.

Lumen does NOT proxy these requests through any Lumen-operated server. The browser talks directly to Google or Dropbox.

If you revoke the tokens (provider dashboard or in-app sign-out), sync stops immediately and the tokens are removed from `localStorage`.

## AI features (opt-in)

If you configure an AI provider (OpenAI by default) and enter an API key:

- The key is held in memory for the duration of your session only (never persisted to localStorage or any other storage).
- AI requests go directly from your browser to the provider's API. Lumen does not proxy.
- Local-only AI is available via WebLLM (`@mlc-ai/web-llm`). When enabled, no AI requests leave your device.

## Collab (opt-in)

When you join a collab room:

- A Yjs document is shared peer-to-peer over WebRTC.
- The default signaling server is the public `wss://signaling.yjs.dev`. You can configure your own via Settings.
- Document changes are encrypted in transit (DTLS via WebRTC). Lumen does not log or persist them.

## Telemetry

Off by default. Lumen ships a Sentry integration point but requires the operator to set `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` at build time to enable it. End-users can also opt out at runtime via the Privacy Mode toggle in the StatusBar.

## GDPR / CCPA rights

Because all your data lives on your device, your rights are exercised directly:

- **Right to access**: open the app — your data is there.
- **Right to delete**: clear browser storage for the Lumen origin OR use the in-app "Reset workspace state" affordance OR delete individual documents.
- **Right to export**: use File → Export to download your workspace as Markdown / HTML / DOCX / PDF.
- **Right to rectification**: edit your documents directly.

If you use the hosted version at lumen.md and it serves a third-party signaling/sync, contact the operator (see the hosted instance's footer) for rights-related questions.
