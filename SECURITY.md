# Security Policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Current |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email **security@lumen.md** with:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Impact assessment (what data or functionality is affected)
4. Your suggested fix, if any

We will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours** and provide a timeline for a fix within **5 business days**.

## Security architecture

Lumen is a **local-first** application. By default, no data leaves the browser.

### Data at rest

| Store | Encryption | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| OPFS workspace | Plaintext (browser-sandboxed) | Same origin only |
| IndexedDB (git, search index) | Plaintext (browser-sandboxed) | Same origin only |
| Secrets vault (`⌘K → Vault`) | AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-derived key | User passphrase required |
| localStorage (preferences) | Plaintext | Same origin only |

### Data in transit

| Feature | Transport | Encryption |
|---|---|---|
| P2P collaboration | WebRTC (DTLS/SRTP) | End-to-end encrypted by default |
| Signaling server | WSS (TLS 1.2+) | Transport-layer only |
| AI prompts (OpenAI) | HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) | Transport-layer only |
| Smart search embeddings | HTTPS to OpenAI | Transport-layer only |
| Git clone/push | HTTPS | Transport-layer only |

### Plugin sandbox

Third-party plugins run in a sandboxed `<iframe>` with:

- `sandbox="allow-scripts"` — **no** `allow-same-origin`
- CSP: `default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https: data:; connect-src https:`
- Communication restricted to a `postMessage` API with an explicit allowlist of callable methods
- Plugin signatures verified via Ed25519 (WebCrypto `verify()`) before installation

### Telemetry

- Sentry error telemetry is **opt-in** (requires `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`)
- Users can opt out at any time via `⌘K → Privacy → Disable telemetry`
- A `beforeSend` hook scrubs all user-content fields (note bodies, vault contents, auth tokens) before any event leaves the browser
- When the DSN is absent or the user opts out, the Sentry SDK is never loaded

### Authentication

- Auth is always optional — Lumen works fully without an account
- When configured, auth uses Supabase (JWT-based) or a custom `AuthProvider`
- API keys are stored in the encrypted secrets vault, not in plaintext localStorage
- The `localProvider` (default) always returns an anonymous session

### Known limitations

- OPFS data is not encrypted at rest (relies on browser origin isolation)
- WebRTC P2P rooms are ephemeral — the signaling server sees room names but not document content
- PlantUML rendering uses the public Kroki API (diagram source is sent to `kroki.io`)
- `htmlpreview` fenced blocks execute user-authored HTML/JS in a sandboxed iframe

## Dependencies

- `npm audit` is run in CI on every push — the gate requires **0 critical / 0 high** vulnerabilities
- Dependabot is configured for automated security updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- The `uuid` package is pinned via `overrides` to avoid transitive vulnerabilities

## Disclosure timeline

We follow a **90-day disclosure policy**. If a fix is not released within 90 days of the initial report, the reporter may publish details publicly.
