# Security Policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Current |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email **security@lumen.md** with:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Impact assessment (what data or functionality is affected)
4. Your suggested fix, if any

We will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours** and provide a timeline for a fix within **5 business days**.

## Security architecture

Lumen is a **local-first** application. By default, no data leaves the browser.

### Data at rest

| Store | Encryption | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| OPFS workspace | Plaintext (browser-sandboxed) | Same origin only |
| IndexedDB (git, search index) | Plaintext (browser-sandboxed) | Same origin only |
| Secrets vault (`⌘K → Vault`) | AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-derived key | User passphrase required |
| localStorage (preferences) | Plaintext | Same origin only |

### Data in transit

| Feature | Transport | Encryption |
|---|---|---|
| P2P collaboration | WebRTC (DTLS/SRTP) | Transport encrypted via WebRTC DTLS (hop-by-hop between peers; signaling servers, relays and the optional persistent y-websocket server are not covered). Password-protected rooms additionally encrypt document updates end-to-end — see [`docs/src/content/docs/collab/encryption.md`](docs/src/content/docs/collab/encryption.md). Rooms without a password are **not** end-to-end encrypted. |
| Signaling server | WSS (TLS 1.2+) | Transport-layer only |
| AI prompts (OpenAI) | HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) | Transport-layer only |
| Smart search embeddings | HTTPS to OpenAI | Transport-layer only |
| Git clone/push | HTTPS | Transport-layer only |

### Plugin sandbox

Third-party plugins run in a sandboxed `<iframe>` with:

- `sandbox="allow-scripts"` — **no** `allow-same-origin`
- CSP: `default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https: data:; connect-src https:`
- Communication restricted to a `postMessage` API with an explicit allowlist of callable methods
- Plugin signatures verified via Ed25519 (WebCrypto `verify()`) before installation

### Telemetry

- Error reports are **off by default**. They are sent only when the user turns them on (the Telemetry pill in the status bar) **and** the build sets `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`. Without both, the Sentry SDK is never loaded and no request is made.
- A Sentry DSN is **public by design, not a secret**: it only lets a client submit events. A build-time `VITE_*` variable is the intended place for it.
- `beforeSend` rebuilds each event from an allowlist: the error type and scrubbed message, plus stack frames reduced to script file names. Quoted text, paths, file names and non-ASCII words are replaced. The request URL, user, breadcrumbs, tags, extra and contexts are dropped. There is no session replay, no tracing and no session tracking.
- Reports go through the privacy ledger under the "monitoring" category, and the local-only policy refuses them. The DSN's host reaches the CSP only through the build-time endpoint mechanism (`src/build/cspEndpoints.ts`); no tracker host or wildcard is hard-coded.
- Web vitals are measured locally and never sent.

### Authentication

- Auth is always optional — Lumen works fully without an account
- When configured, auth uses Supabase (JWT-based) or a custom `AuthProvider`
- API keys are stored in the encrypted secrets vault, not in plaintext localStorage
- The `localProvider` (default) always returns an anonymous session

### Known limitations

- OPFS data is not encrypted at rest (relies on browser origin isolation)
- WebRTC P2P rooms are ephemeral. Signaling servers see room names and peer metadata; without a room password, anything routed through a signaling/relay or persistent sync server is not end-to-end encrypted. Use a room password for end-to-end encryption of document updates (see `docs/src/content/docs/collab/encryption.md`)
- PlantUML rendering uses the public Kroki API (diagram source is sent to `kroki.io`)
- `htmlpreview` fenced blocks execute user-authored HTML/JS in a sandboxed iframe

## Dependencies

- `npm audit` is run in CI on every push — the gate requires **0 critical / 0 high** vulnerabilities
- Dependabot is configured for automated security updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- The `uuid` package is pinned via `overrides` to avoid transitive vulnerabilities

## Disclosure timeline

We follow a **90-day disclosure policy**. If a fix is not released within 90 days of the initial report, the reporter may publish details publicly.
