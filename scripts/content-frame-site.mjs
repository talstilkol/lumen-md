/**
 * The content frame's own site (plan W6.40, review E52): a folder with only
 * the frame's page (public/content-frame.html as index.html: Cloudflare Pages
 * answers /x.html with a redirect to /x, and / needs none), its script and
 * deploy/content-frame/_headers, for a static host on another site than the
 * app — the official one is a Cloudflare Pages project by Direct Upload,
 * https://lumen-md-frame.pages.dev/.
 *
 *   node scripts/content-frame-site.mjs            → dist-frame/
 *   npx wrangler pages deploy dist-frame --project-name lumen-md-frame
 *   then build the app with VITE_CONTENT_FRAME_URL=https://lumen-md-frame.pages.dev/
 *
 * The site sees only `GET /` and `/content-frame.js`: what
 * the frame shows travels in the #fragment, which a browser never sends.
 * `node scripts/headers.mjs --check` checks deploy/content-frame/_headers
 * against security/policy.json (host content-frame-site).
