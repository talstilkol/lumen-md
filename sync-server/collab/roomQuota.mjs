/**
 * New-room limits for the public collab server (review 2 RR2-469-1, review 4, review 6).
 *
 * One Durable Object (`Quota`, one instance named "quota") counts, per UTC day:
 *   - new rooms on the whole server   COLLAB_NEW_ROOMS_PER_DAY      (default 2,000)
 *   - new rooms per client address     COLLAB_NEW_ROOMS_PER_ADDRESS  (default 20)
 *     (an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 /64)
 *   - new rooms per IPv6 /48           COLLAB_NEW_ROOMS_PER_48       (default 4 × the per-address limit)
 * and, all the time, what is stored (review 6, RR6-469-2):
 *   - rooms                            COLLAB_MAX_ROOMS              (default 20,000)
 *   - bytes                            COLLAB_MAX_STORED_BYTES       (default 4 GB, under the
 *                                      Workers Free plan's 5 GB of Durable Object storage)
 *   - rooms per address                COLLAB_STORED_ROOMS_PER_ADDRESS (default 50)
 * When the rooms or the bytes are full, a new room may take the place of a
 * stored one that nobody came back to: the smallest first, then the least
 * recently written. A room someone joined again (a second person, or the same
 * one later) within COLLAB_PROTECT_DAYS (default 14) is never evicted, and
 * neither is a room with someone connected.
 *
 * The day is the Quota's own (review 6, RR6-469-1): a room passes ids that do
 * not depend on the day, and the Quota turns them into the day's bucket
 * names with its own clock, which never moves backwards. So a socket opened
 * before midnight and authenticated after it counts against today, and can't
 * reset today's counts.
 *
 * Why a Durable Object and not the Workers rate-limit binding: the binding
 * needs wrangler 4.36 (the deploy script pins 4.20.0), counts per Cloudflare
 * location, not globally, is eventually consistent, and only knows periods of
 * 10 or 60 seconds. A daily cap on the whole server needs one exact counter.
 *
 * What it keeps, and no address:
 *   - the day's counts under bucket names that are an HMAC, under a key for
 *     the day, of an HMAC of the address (from COLLAB_TOKEN_SECRET); the
 *     previous day's buckets are dropped with the day;
 *   - per stored room (by its Durable Object id): its size, when it was last
 *     written and last joined again, and its owner: 20 bits of a keyed hash
 *     of the address that created it. About 4,000 IPv4 addresses share each
 *     owner value, so it names none, and two people who share one rarely
 *     both have rooms.
 * A room is counted once, when its first peer authenticates and nothing of
 * it is stored yet.
 * The counter itself is the `Quota` Durable Object in edge-workers/collab/worker.mjs;
 * this file is its pure part (tested in plain Node).
