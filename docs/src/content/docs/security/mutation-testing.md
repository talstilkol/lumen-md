title: Mutation testing
description: How Lumen checks that the tests of its security-critical code, such as encryption, the keyring, sync merges and the privacy ledger, really catch bugs.
---

Coverage tells you which lines ran, not whether a test would notice if they
were wrong. Mutation testing checks that. It plants small bugs in the code,
one at a time, and runs the tests each time. A test suite that still passes
with a bug in place has missed it.

## What is tested

The pure modules whose bugs would hurt most:

- **Encryption primitives:** ChaCha20-Poly1305, BLAKE2b, scrypt and Argon2id.
- **age** file encryption, and the **keyring** that holds the vault keys and
  devices.
- The **sync engine**: conflict merging, the manifest and blob headers.
- The **privacy ledger**, which records and blocks anything that would leave
  the device.

The list is in `scripts/mutation/targets.json`.

## The bugs it plants

| Kind | Example |
|---|---|
| Operators | `+` ↔ `-`, `<` ↔ `<=`, `===` ↔ `!==`, `&&` ↔ `\|\|`, `<<` ↔ `>>`, `^` → `&` |
| Constants | `n` → `n + 1` (`1` → `0`) |
| Booleans | `true` ↔ `false` |
| Negation | `!x` → `x` |
| Conditions | `if (c)` → `if (!(c))` |

Only code is mutated, never types, imports or comments. A mutant that
doesn't parse is left out. A mutant counts as **caught** when a test that
passes on the real code fails, when the run crashes, or when it hangs.

## Running it

```sh
npm run test:mutation                          # all modules, fails under 70%
node scripts/mutation/run.mjs --module keyring # one module
node scripts/mutation/run.mjs --max 200        # a bigger sample per module
```

The report, with the score per module and every surviving mutant's line, is
written to `reports/mutation/`. The plan's target is a score of at least
70% per module. A mutant that survives in a security module should get a
test that catches it.
