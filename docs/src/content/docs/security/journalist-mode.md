title: "Journalist mode: redaction and locked notes"
description: Text you redact is removed from every export, not covered. A note can be locked with a password of its own.

Reporters, lawyers and researchers keep notes about people who must not be
named. Lumen has two tools for that, on top of [photo metadata
removal](/security/photo-metadata/).

## True redaction

Select the text and run **Redact selection** from the command palette. The
text is wrapped in `<redact>…</redact>`: you still see it in your note,
shaded, and it is **removed** from every export — PDF, print, DOCX, HTML,
Markdown, RTF, LaTeX, EPUB, slides and the rest. In its place the export has
`█████`, always five blocks, so the length of a name gives nothing away.

This is not a black box drawn over text that is still there (a well-known
leak in PDFs: copy the box, or run `pdftotext`, and the text comes back).
The exporters never receive the text at all.

The rules fail closed:

- A `<redact>` that is never closed removes everything after it.
- Marks count inside code blocks too.
- Exports also leave out hidden text a reader of the file could find: HTML
  comments (`<!-- … -->`) and Obsidian comments (`%% … %%`).
- **Print** (⌘P) of a note with redactions goes through the same export.

What it does not do: the note itself keeps the text (that is the point), so
syncing or sharing the *note* shares the text. Redact before you export, and
share the export.

## A note with its own password

Run **Note password…** on a note saved in the vault. The note is encrypted
with a password of its own, separate from the vault's: on disk, in sync and
in backups it is ciphertext, with one line saying how to open it.

- **Opening:** open the note, run **Note password…**, type the password. It
  stays open until you choose **Lock now** or close Lumen; the password is
  never stored.
- **While it is open,** what Lumen keeps on the device (the open tabs, the
  version history) keeps the encrypted text, not the plain one. Locking a
  note deletes its earlier, plain versions from history.
- **Forgotten password = lost note.** There is no recovery key, by design.
- The key comes from the password through the vault's key-derivation
  function (PBKDF2-SHA256, 600,000 iterations today; Argon2id once it lands),
  and every save is sealed with AES-256-GCM under a fresh nonce.

Limits, plainly: the note's *name* is not hidden; "Save as" makes a plain
copy; anything you copy out of an open note is plain text; and a device
that is compromised while the note is open can read it.
