title: Monitoring and web vitals
description: Error reports are off by default and sent only with your consent; web vitals never leave your device.

Lumen measures how fast it is on your device, and can send crash reports
to an error tracker, but only after you turn them on. Both work the same
way in every build.

## Web vitals: measured here, never sent

Lumen measures five page-speed metrics with the browser's
`PerformanceObserver`:

| Metric | What it is | Good |
|---|---|---|
| LCP | Largest Contentful Paint: when the largest visible element appears | ≤ 2.5 s |
| FCP | First Contentful Paint: when the first content appears | ≤ 1.8 s |
| TTFB | Time to First Byte: when the server's first response byte arrives | ≤ 800 ms |
| INP | Interaction to Next Paint: the slowest interaction this session | ≤ 200 ms |
| CLS | Cumulative Layout Shift: how much the layout jumps without your input | ≤ 0.1 |

The values stay in memory on your device. Open them with **Runtime
metrics** in the status bar, or from the command palette. They are never
sent, even when error reports are on. A sample stores no page address.

## Error reports: off by default

Lumen sends error reports only when **both** of these are true:

1. **You turned them on.** Click the **Telemetry** pill in the status bar.
   It is off in a fresh install. Click it again to turn reports off.
   Turning them off takes effect at once, even for an error that is
   already being reported.
2. **The build names an error tracker** in `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`. This can be
   Sentry or a self-hosted GlitchTip, which speaks the same protocol.

If either one is missing, the Sentry SDK is never downloaded and no
request is made. The default build has no DSN, so it makes no monitoring
requests at all. An e2e test (`e2e/monitoring.spec.ts`) checks this.

### What a report contains

Each report is rebuilt from a short allowlist before it leaves the browser:

- the error's class name, such as `TypeError`;
- the script file names, functions and line numbers of the stack trace;
- the app's release and environment, and the SDK's name and version.

The error **message is never sent**. A message can contain a title or a
line of a note without quotes ("Failed to save Quarterly plan"), and no
filter can reliably tell that apart from the app's own words. The stack
trace shows where the error happened, and that is enough to find it.

A report never includes:

- the error message, or any text logged with it;
- the page address;
- breadcrumbs, such as clicks, console lines and requests;
- user or IP data (`infer_ip: never`);
- tags, extra data or contexts.

There is no session replay, no performance tracing and no session
tracking.

### Every report is in the privacy ledger

Error reports go through the privacy ledger (command palette → **Privacy
ledger**) like every other request that leaves the device. Each one is listed under its own
category: "Error report — only with your consent, content removed". The
ledger shows where the report went, its size and its status. Under the
**local-only** AI policy, reports are refused before they leave, and each
refusal is listed as blocked.

## For operators: setting the DSN

Set the DSN at build time:

```bash
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://<public-key>@o123.ingest.sentry.io/4567 npm run build
# Docker: docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.web --build-arg VITE_SENTRY_DSN=… .
```

**A DSN is not a secret.** Sentry designs it to be public: it ships in
every page that uses Sentry, and it only lets a client *submit* events
to one project. It can't read data. So a build-time `VITE_*` variable is
the right place for it, and secret scanners may ignore it.

The DSN's host is added to the CSP `connect-src` **automatically at build
time**, through the same mechanism as the other deployment endpoints
(`src/build/cspEndpoints.ts`). That covers the `index.html` meta tag,
`dist/_headers` and the nginx image. No error-tracker host or wildcard is
in the checked-in policies.

On **Vercel**, `vercel.json` sets a static CSP header that the build can't
rewrite. Add your DSN's origin, for example `https://o123.ingest.sentry.io`,
to `connect-src` in `vercel.json` yourself. Otherwise the browser blocks
the reports.

## בעברית

- **מדדי ביצועים (Web Vitals)** נמדדים במכשיר שלך ולא נשלחים לשום מקום.
  אפשר לראות אותם בחלון "מדדי ריצה" בשורת המצב.
- **דוחות שגיאה כבויים כברירת מחדל.** הם נשלחים רק אם הפעלת אותם בכפתור
  "טלמטריה" בשורת המצב, **וגם** הבנייה כוללת כתובת DSN של שירות מעקב.
- הדוח כולל רק את סוג השגיאה ואת מיקומה בקוד. הודעת השגיאה, תוכן הפתקים,
  הכותרות והנתיבים לא נשלחים. אין הקלטת סשן ואין מידע מזהה.
- כל דוח מופיע ביומן הפרטיות. במדיניות "מקומי בלבד" הדוחות נחסמים.
