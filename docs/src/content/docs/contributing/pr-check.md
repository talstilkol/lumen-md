title: The PR check
description: npm run pr:check is the local PR gate that replaces Danger.js and size-limit. It reports bundle size against the base, PR body sections, [skip ci] commits, unregistered network calls, licences and the domain rule.
---

Lumen runs no GitHub Actions on pull requests. Danger.js and size-limit
need Actions, so one local command replaces them (plan 0.19):

```bash
npm run build
npm run pr:check -- --base origin/main --body pr-body.md --build-base --out pr-check.md
```

The report is Markdown. Paste it into the pull request. The command exits
with 1 when a check fails. Warnings do not fail it.

## The checks

- **Bundle size.** The gzipped size of each chunk class (`npm run budget -- --json`),
  compared with the base, as a table. The bundle budget's own verdict
  decides pass or fail. The base's sizes come from one of:
  - `--base-sizes <file>`;
  - `--build-base`, which builds the merge base in a temporary worktree
    that links this checkout's `node_modules`.
- **Commits.** Every subject from the merge base to `HEAD` contains
  `[skip ci]`.
- **PR body.** The file passed with `--body` has every section, none
  empty:
  - What and why
  - Definition of done (plan 0.7)
  - Local verification
  - Not verified here
  - Owner commands
- **Network.** Every new call that sends a request (`fetch`, `WebSocket`,
  `EventSource`, `sendBeacon`, `importScripts`) goes to a host listed in
  the privacy ledger (`src/ai/privacyLedger.ts`). A call whose URL is
  computed instead needs a `// privacy-ledger: <rule>` comment.
- **Licences.** Every production package added or changed in the
  lockfile has an allowed licence (no copyleft, no non-commercial, not
  missing).
- **Domain.** No added line names the project's domain.
- **Budgets only go down** (plan W6.26). A diff that raises a bundle
  budget, the startup budget, an exception's expiry date, the ratchet
  margin, a performance-gate FCP/LCP limit or a Lighthouse assertion
  fails. So does a budget number written into `scripts/bundle-budget.mjs`
  itself. See [Budgets that only go down](/contributing/budgets/).

It also warns:
- when source changed and no test did;
- when an AI agent wrote the PR (add the `ai-written` label).
