description: Clone, pull and push a git repository from Lumen — safely. A pull merges, never deletes, and never overwrites a note you are editing.
---

Lumen can keep a folder of your vault in step with a git repository. Everything runs in the app (via [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org)); there is no Lumen server in between.

Commands (⌘K):

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Git: clone repository…** | Copies a repository into a folder of the vault. |
| **Git: pull current repo** | Fetches and merges the remote into that folder (see below). |
| **Git: commit & push current repo…** | Commits the folder and pushes it. |
| **Git: status (current repo)** | Added / modified / deleted files. |
| **Git: toggle watch-mode auto-pull** | Pulls every 5 minutes while the tab is visible. |
| **Git: set CORS proxy…** | The proxy git requests go through in a browser. |
| **Git: set access token…** | Only needed for private repositories and for pushing. |

## What a pull does (and never does)

A pull is **fetch + three-way merge** into the vault:

- A file only the remote changed is updated.
- A file you changed and the remote did not is left alone.
- A file both of you changed is merged line by line. Edits to different lines merge on their own.
- Edits to **the same lines** are a **conflict**. The file then holds both versions between the usual markers:

  ```text
  <<<<<<< local
  your line
  =======
  their line
  >>>>>>> remote
  ```

  The resolution screen opens for each conflict: keep yours, take theirs, or pick per hunk. If you choose **Resolve later**, the markers stay in the file, and **commit refuses** until they are gone, so markers never get pushed by accident. Before a conflicted or merged file is rewritten, its previous text goes into Version History ("before git pull").

What a pull **never** does:

- **It never deletes a file.** A file deleted upstream stays in your vault, and the pull says which. Delete it yourself if you want it gone.
- **It never touches files git does not track.** Your own notes in the repository folder are not looked at.
- **It never overwrites a note open with unsaved edits.** A clean merge goes into the editor and is saved the normal way. On a conflict the note is left exactly as it is, and the remote version is kept next to it as `name (git 1a2b3c4).md`.
- **It never merges binary files.** If both sides changed an image, yours stays and theirs is kept as a copy.

Cloning into a folder that already exists keeps every file that is already there. Files already there with different content are counted, not overwritten.

### Shallow clones

A clone fetches only the latest commit (depth 1). A merge needs the commit both sides share (the *merge base*), so when a pull cannot find it, Lumen deepens the clone automatically: 50, then 500, then 5,000 commits, and finally the full history.

## Public repositories need no token

Clone and pull work on public repositories without a token. You need a token (GitHub: a fine-grained personal access token with *Contents: read & write*) only for private repositories and for pushing. The token stays on this device in the encrypted secret store.

## CORS proxy

Browsers only let a page talk to servers that allow it (CORS), and GitHub, GitLab and most git hosts don't allow it for git traffic. In the browser, git therefore goes through a **CORS proxy**. The desktop app and git servers that send CORS headers don't need one.

**Lumen has no built-in proxy.** Choose one of these:

1. **Run one on this machine** (recommended):

   ```sh
   docker compose -f docker/git-proxy.yml up -d
   ```

   Then go to ⌘K → **Git: set CORS proxy…** → `http://localhost:9999`. Lumen's Content-Security-Policy already allows `localhost:9999`.

2. **A proxy your deployment hosts.** Build with `VITE_GIT_CORS_PROXY=https://git-proxy.example.com`. The build adds that origin to the CSP `connect-src`, and it becomes the default for every user. A user's own setting (option 1) still takes precedence.

The proxy is [@isomorphic-git/cors-proxy](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/cors-proxy) (MIT). It forwards only git smart-HTTP requests and stores nothing. Your token passes through it in the `Authorization` header, so only use a proxy you trust.

If a clone or pull fails before it reaches the git host, Lumen says so and points to this setting.

## Git LFS is not supported

Repositories that use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) store large files as small *pointer* files, and the real content lives on a separate LFS server that Lumen does not talk to. What happens:

- A clone writes the pointer files as they are and lists them, so you know those files are not the real content.
- A pull **never replaces a real file with a pointer**. If the vault has the real file and upstream has a pointer, the file is kept and reported.

To work with LFS content, check the repository out with the git command line and open that folder as your vault.
