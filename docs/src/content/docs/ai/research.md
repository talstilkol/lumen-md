## Research: Ask a Question

Command: `🔎 Research: Ask a Question…`.

Lumen searches the web, reads the sources and writes a new note. The
note starts with a short summary, followed by sections, and every claim
carries a footnote. Each footnote holds the passage from the source
that supports the claim:

```md
Roses are pruned in early spring.[^1]

[^1]: [Rose guide](https://example.org/roses) — “Prune roses in early spring, when buds swell.”
```

Choose how Lumen searches with `🔎 Research: Settings…`:

| Search | Needs | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude web search** (default) | AI provider set to Claude (Anthropic) | One request: Claude searches (up to 5 searches), reads and answers. The quotes are copied word for word from the pages by Anthropic. Anthropic bills the searches separately from tokens. |
| **SearXNG** / **Brave Search** / **Tavily** | The research service on this deployment (a local SearXNG needs no key; Brave and Tavily need yours) | The **researcher agent** runs on your AI model, local first, in a tool loop. It searches (`search_web`), reads the pages it chooses (`fetch_page`), and copies the passages it cites (`extract_quotes`). Then Lumen **checks every quote against the page it came from**, outside the model. A quote that can't be found is marked ⚠️ in the note. If fewer than half of the quotes are in their pages, the agent tries once more and is told to quote word for word. |

Under the **local only** AI policy:
- **With a remote research service:** the same agent answers from your **clip library** (`Library/`, `ספרייה/`) and nothing leaves the device.
- **With a research service on this machine:** every search and every page read asks you first. Only the search query, or the page address, is sent.

Every page is outside content: the agent gets it cleaned and delimited, and instructions planted in it are flagged (see Local agents → Outside content). The note is saved with `untrusted: true` in its frontmatter.

Pages the research read but didn't cite are listed under "Also read".
Every model call appears in `AI: Usage & Cost This Month`. A research
run counts as one prompt against your plan's AI quota.

## Research: Verify Citations in This Note

Command: `🔎 Research: Verify Citations in This Note`.

This works on any note, not only research output. Lumen reads the
footnotes that link to web pages and checks each one:

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ quote found | The quoted passage is on the page. Quote marks, dashes, case and spacing don't need to match exactly. |
| 🟡 found approximately | At least 85% of the quote's words appear close together on the page. |
| ❌ quote not found | The page is reachable, but the passage isn't on it. |
| 💀 dead link | The page returned an HTTP error. |
| ⚠️ couldn't read | The address was blocked, the page isn't HTML or text, or the request timed out. |
| 🔗 reachable | The footnote has no quote, so only the link was checked. |

Footnotes can be written as `[^1]: [Title](url) — “quote”`, as
`[^1]: url "quote"`, or as just a link.

## The research service

Reading pages and Brave / Tavily searches go through a small worker that
your deployment runs (`edge-workers/research`, set with
`VITE_RESEARCH_ENDPOINT`). Browsers can't fetch other sites directly.

- It only reads public http(s) pages, never internal addresses.
- It reads at most 2 MB per page.
- It forwards no cookies.
- Your search key is passed through for each request and is never
  stored.
- It only answers your app's own origins.

Claude web search doesn't need the service.
